# DIY macro keyboard

## Long story short: 
I wanted a macro keyboard without any software or anything. Just a macro keyboard that it could also work on the go, so I started looking around for it, but they are at least 59 to 80 $. So I decided to DIY a Bluetooth keyboard that was laying around my desk for a while. The only caveat was that I also wanted to keep the Bluetooth functionality.
